  <h1>Coaches</h1>
  <h2>How Does Coaching at CSSclasses Work?</h2>
  <p>In our workshops, learners follow along the tasks on their own computers. Learners have to figure out how to solve certain problems, and might get stuck or need help – that’s what coaches are for! To give advice, to explain something and help learners to follow along with the tutorial. Coaches don’t have to be around the entire day, just a few hours of help are great too.</p>
  <h2>Who Can Be a Coach?</h2>
  <p>Everyone! As soon as you can help the learner next to you, you are a coach. No need to be an expert. No one knows the answer to everything – if you are not sure or stuck with a question, just ask another coach to help out.</p>
  <h2>How Do Coaches Prepare?</h2>
  <p>Be sure to read the <a href="https://opentechschool.github.io/slides/presentations/coaching/" target="_blank">OpenTechSchool Coaches Guide</a>, and also take a look at the <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html" target="_blank">Core Values</a>. Make sure to be familiar with our <a href="{{ site.url }}/materials">Learning Materials</a>. Also please arrive at 9:30 am on the workshop day, to attend our Coaches briefing and help prepare the venue.</p>
  <h2>Where Else Can I Help And Ask Questions?</h2>
  <p>Hang out with us in our <a href="https://cssclasses.slack.com/messages" target="_blank">Slack Chat</a>. This is where we discuss and plan the workshops. You can also follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/cssclasses" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
