#Learning Materials

These are the learning materials for the CSSclasses beginners workshop. In this workshop, you’ll learn the very basics of creating a website. We’ll walk through every step together, and our coaches will assist you if you run into any problems or have questions. At the end of the workshop, you’ll find tips and links on how to educate yourself further, and ideas and suggestions on what to experiment with.
