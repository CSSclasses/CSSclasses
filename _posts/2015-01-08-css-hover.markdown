### Hover
Hover is a small example of how you can add some fun little interactivity to your site. Let's take our `div` example from above and add a little bit to our CSS:

{% include switch.html %}

{% highlight CSS %}
div {
  color: white;
  background-color: green;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
div:hover {
  background-color: red;
  border: 5px dotted black;
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you apply this CSS to our [border example]({% post_url 2015-01-06-css-border %}), you will see no change at first. But if you move your mouse cursor over the `div` (you "hover" it), you will see the style changes applied, that we defined with the `div:hover` pseudo-class. There are some more pseudo-classes like that that you can learn about later.
