  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
  <p>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other</p>

  <h2>Need Help?</h2>
  <p>Please tweet/DM us at <a href="" target="_blanK">@cssclasses</a> or talk to <a href="/about/">us</a> directly.</p>

  <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
  <p>Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any parts of our events, including talks, workshops, Twitter and other online media. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from this meetup and/or any future meetups at the discretion of the usergroup organisers.</p>

  <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
  <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.</p>
  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the usergroup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup and/or any future meetups.</p>
  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any of the team members immediately.</p>
  <p>We will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
  <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues and usergroup-related social events.</p>
